## Implementation Log

### 2025-01-14: Project Start

- Created progress tracking document
- Reviewed existing codebase structure
- Identified key files to modify:
  - Client: `live.jsx`, `websocket-message-handler.js`
  - Server: `server.py`, `json_generator.py`

### 2025-01-14: Phase 1 Complete

- Implemented client ID generation using sessionStorage
  - UUID v4 generation with crypto.randomUUID fallback
  - Persists across page reloads within session
- Added ClientRegistry class for server-side tracking
  - Tracks client->websocket mapping
  - Tracks file->clients mapping
  - Auto-cleanup on disconnect
- Modified client to send watch/unwatch messages
  - Sends watch on file navigation
  - Sends unwatch when leaving file
  - Includes client ID in all messages
- Server now logs watched files (telemetry phase)
  - No execution changes yet
  - Provides visibility into client behavior

### 2025-01-14: Phase 2 Complete

- Implemented FileDependencyGraph class
  - AST-based import analysis
  - Handles relative and absolute imports
  - Ignores external (stdlib/third-party) imports
  - Tracks transitive dependencies
- Features:
  - Forward dependencies (file -> imports)
  - Reverse dependencies (file -> imported by)
  - Affected files calculation (including transitive)
  - Cache with mtime-based invalidation
- Integration:
  - Builds initial graph on server start
  - Updates graph when files change
  - Logs affected files and watched status
  - Still executes ALL files (telemetry only)

## Design Decisions

### Client ID Generation

- ✅ Using UUID v4 with sessionStorage
- Rationale: Simple, no server coordination needed
- Persists within browser session, new ID on new session

### Dependency Tracking Library

- ✅ Built custom AST-based solution
- Rationale: Full control, no extra dependencies
- Uses Python's built-in `ast` module
- Caches results with mtime checking

### Message Protocol

- ✅ Watch/unwatch messages include clientId
- ✅ Server maintains registry of active watches
- ✅ Auto-cleanup on disconnect

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests

1. Client ID generation and persistence
2. Watch/unwatch message formatting
3. Client registry operations
4. Dependency graph building
5. Targeted execution filtering

### Integration Tests

1. Multi-client file watching
2. Dependency cascade updates
3. Client disconnect/reconnect
4. Performance benchmarks

## Notes & Observations

- The current system already has incremental execution at the block level
- Need to extend this to file-level awareness
- Phase 1 is now complete - telemetry collection working without changing execution

## Phase 1 Summary ✅

Successfully implemented client registration and watch/unwatch protocol:

1. **Client Changes**:
   - Added `client-id.js` for UUID generation
   - Modified `live.jsx` to send watch/unwatch messages
   - Client ID persists in sessionStorage
2. **Server Changes**:
   - Added `ClientRegistry` class
   - Modified WebSocket handler to process watch/unwatch
   - Logs watched files for telemetry
3. **Current Behavior**:
   - Server still executes ALL files (no change)
   - Server still broadcasts to ALL clients (no change)
   - But now we know which clients watch which files
4. **Testing**:
   - All unit tests passing (Python and JavaScript)
   - Integration tests updated for new message flow
   - Manual testing confirms watch/unwatch messages are sent
5. **Key Learnings**:
   - sessionStorage is perfect for client ID (persists in tab)
   - Watch/unwatch protocol is simple and reliable
   - No performance impact (telemetry only)
6. **Next Steps**:
   - Phase 2: Implement dependency tracking
   - Phase 3: Use registry to filter execution
   - Phase 4: Target broadcasts to interested clients only

## Phase 2 Summary ✅

Successfully implemented file-level dependency tracking:

1. **Dependency Analysis**:

   - Custom AST-based import analyzer
   - Handles absolute, relative, and star imports
   - Filters out external dependencies (stdlib/third-party)
   - Tracks both forward and reverse dependencies

2. **Caching & Performance**:

   - mtime-based cache invalidation
   - Only re-analyzes changed files
   - Initial graph build on server start

3. **Integration**:
   - Dependency graph updates on file changes
   - Logs affected files and their watch status
   - Shows transitive dependencies
4. **Current Behavior**:
   - Server builds and maintains dependency graph
   - Logs show which files are affected by changes
   - Logs show which affected files are being watched
   - Still executes ALL files (no filtering yet)
5. **Example Output**:

   ```
   Building initial dependency graph...
   Dependency graph: 42 files, 87 imports
   File changed: demo_config.py (affects 3 files)
     Watched affected files: demo_main.py
   ```

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Phase 3: Use dependency + watch info to filter execution
   - Only execute files that are both affected AND watched

## Phase 3 Summary ✅

Successfully implemented targeted execution with cache management:

1. **Execution Filtering**:

   - Server only executes files that are being watched
   - Uses dependency graph to find affected files
   - Filters execution to watched affected files only
   - Logs show which files are skipped

2. **Client-Specific Broadcasting**:

   - Added `_ws_broadcast_to_file_watchers` method
   - Messages now sent only to clients watching specific files
   - Reduced unnecessary network traffic

3. **Cache Management**:

   - Created `CacheManager` class with file-aware eviction
   - Tracks cache entries by source file
   - LRU eviction with hot entry protection
   - Files marked for eviction when unwatched
   - Periodic eviction task runs every 30 seconds

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Cache manager integrated with IncrementalExecutor
   - Watch/unwatch messages trigger eviction marking
   - Cache stats logged periodically (in verbose mode)
5. **Current Behavior**:
   - Server executes ONLY watched files
   - Broadcasts ONLY to watching clients
   - Cache grows for watched files
   - Cache evicted for unwatched files
6. **Key Implementation Details**:

   - `_watch_for_changes` filters execution by watched files
   - `_trigger_build` uses targeted broadcasts
   - `_periodic_cache_eviction` runs as background task
   - Cache entries protected if accessed recently

7. **Example Output**:
   ```
   File changed: demo_config.py (affects 3 files, 1 watched)
     Executing for: demo_main.py
   File changed: utils.py (no watched files affected, skipping)
   Cache stats: 42 entries, 15.2MB, hit rate: 78.34%
   ```

## Phase 3.5 Summary ✅

Successfully optimized import analysis for better performance:

1. **Improved External Import Detection**:

   - Replaced brittle allow-lists with `importlib.util.find_spec`
   - Only track imports within project directory
   - External modules (stdlib, venv) are automatically ignored

2. **Performance Gains**:

   - No more analyzing stdlib/third-party imports
   - Startup time significantly reduced
   - Analysis of files with many imports: ~1.4ms
   - Full project scan (9 files): ~1ms

3. **Simplified Code**:

   - Removed hardcoded `stdlib_modules` and `third_party` sets
   - More maintainable - no need to update lists
   - Automatically adapts to any Python environment

4. **Key Implementation**:

   ```python
   def _is_external_import(self, module_name: str) -> bool:
       spec = find_spec(module_name)
       if spec is None or spec.origin is None:
           return True
       module_path = pathlib.Path(spec.origin).resolve()
       return not self._is_within_base(module_path)
   ```

5. **Testing**:

   - All existing tests pass
   - Added performance tests to verify improvements
   - Confirmed external imports are properly ignored

6. **Additional Optimizations**:

   - Skip hidden directories (`.venv`, `.git`, etc.) during analysis
   - Added safety check to prevent external files from entering the graph
   - Reduced unnecessary `find_spec` calls with quick pattern checks

7. **Performance Impact**:

   - No longer analyzing thousands of files in `.venv` or other hidden dirs
   - Graph only contains files within the project directory
   - Startup time should be significantly improved

8. **Pyright Fixes**:
   - Fixed all type annotation issues
   - All tests pass with no pyright errors
   - Codebase is now fully type-safe

## Phase 4 Summary ✅

Successfully verified client state scoping:

1. **Existing Implementation**:

   - Client already uses `useStateWithDeps` to scope `blockResults` to current file
   - State automatically clears when navigating between files
   - No accumulation of state across files

2. **Message Filtering**:

   - Server sends messages only to clients watching specific files
   - Prevents unnecessary data transfer and processing
   - Client receives targeted updates

3. **Navigation Behavior**:

   - Pinning feature works correctly
   - When unpinned: client follows file changes
   - When pinned: client stays on current file
   - State management works correctly in both modes

4. **Key Learning**:
   - The client was already well-designed for state scoping
   - Our server-side improvements complement the existing client architecture
   - No client-side changes were needed for Phase 4

## Phase 5 Progress

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Removed Legacy Broadcast Behavior**:

   - Deleted `_ws_broadcast` method that sent to all clients
   - All messages now use `_ws_broadcast_to_file_watchers` for targeted delivery
   - Fallback reload case now properly iterates through watched files

2. **Added File-Changed Notification System**:

   - New notification type for single file changes
   - 100ms throttle to batch rapid changes
   - Only sends notification if exactly one file changed
   - Includes watched status in notification
   - Client handles notification based on pinning state:
     - If unpinned: navigates to changed file
     - If pinned: stays on current file
   - Preserves existing "follow mode" behavior while being more efficient

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Server buffers changed files in `_changed_files_buffer`
   - Throttled notification task with cancellation for new changes
   - Notification sent to ALL clients (not just watchers)
   - Client decides whether to navigate based on pin state
   - Added comprehensive tests for notification system
